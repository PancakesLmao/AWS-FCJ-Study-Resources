# Operational Excellence 
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures

Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible change
# Security
The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies

When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:
- Automate security best practices when possible
- Apply security at all layers
- Protect data in transit and at rest
# Reliability
The ability of a system to:
- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as transient network issues or misconfigurations
Reliability also includes:
- Testing recovery procedures
- Scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Automatically recovering from failure
# Performance Efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve

Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes

# Cost Optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 

Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.
