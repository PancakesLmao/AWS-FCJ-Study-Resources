# AWS Pricing Models
## Pay-as-you-go
You can use pay-as-you-go to easily adapt to changing business needs and improve your responsiveness to changes, without overcommitting your budgets. With a pay-as-you-go model, you can adapt your business **based on need and not forecasts**, thus reducing the risk of overprovisioning or missing capacity.
## Save when you reserve/commit
These plans are often referred to as purchasing reserving instances. For AWS compute, AWS machine learning, and AWS database services, Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount. This amount is measured in $/hour of an AWS service or a category of services, for a 1-year or 3-year period.
## Pay less by using more
With AWS, you can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as Amazon S3, pricing is tiered, which means that the more you use, the less you pay per GB.
