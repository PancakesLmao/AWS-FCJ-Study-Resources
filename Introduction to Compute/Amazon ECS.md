Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and high-performance container management system. It helps customers create new containers and manage them across EC2 instances. Amazon ECS supports Docker containers. Docker is a software platform that packages software (such as applications) into containers.

To manage your containers, you must install an open-source Amazon ECS container agent on your EC2 instances. This agent is referred to as a container instance. You can run this agent on both Linux and Windows Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Amazon ECS uses API calls to control Docker-enabled applications.
