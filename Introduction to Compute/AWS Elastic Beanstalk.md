AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling of web applications. You can upload your code, and Elastic Beanstalk **automatically handles the deployment**, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time. 
There's **no additional charge** for Elastic Beanstalk; you pay for only the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.
