# Instances
Instances / Virtual Machine is the computing resources **IN** the cloud. It can handle tasks like hosting websites, running apps, managing databases, and handling authentication—just like a normal server.
To set it up, you can choose the OS, CPU, memory, and storage. It takes just a few minutes to be ready. As soon as you're done, you can stop or terminate the instances
### Use cases
- Hosting environment
- Development and testing environments 
- Backup and disaster recovery
# Containers
Containers are a way to run applications in isolated environments using OS virtualization. They **package everything** an app needs—code, settings, and dependencies—into a single unit.
Containers are smaller than virtual machines and do not contain an entire operating system. 
Instead, containers share a virtualized OS and run as resource- isolated processes, which ensure quick, reliable, and consistent deployments.
### Use cases
- Building microservices architecture 
- Video rendering services
- Quick development and deployment
# Serverless
Serverless computing gives you the ability to **run code without provisioning or managing servers**. Serverless computing features **automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and a pay-for-use billing model** to increase agility and optimize costs. 
Serverless computing also **eliminates infrastructure management tasks** like capacity provisioning and patching, so you can focus on writing code that serves your customers.
### Use Cases
- File processing
- Web applications
- Mobile backends
- Cron jobs (scheduled computing tasks)
# Hybrid
It connects **cloud resources** with **on-premises infrastructure** (your existing local servers)
This setup is useful in various scenarios, such as when:
- You have legacy applications that are best maintained on-premises.
- Regulations require certain data to remain on-premises.
For example, a company might use cloud services for automated data processing and analytics while keeping older applications on-premises because they are not suited for cloud migration. A hybrid deployment allows the company to take advantage of cloud-based tools while maintaining essential systems on-site.
### Use Cases
- Legacy applications
- Company regulatory requirements
- Government regulatory requirements
