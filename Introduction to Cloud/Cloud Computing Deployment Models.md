# Cloud-based
You can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staffs to manage them. Or build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure
# Hybrid
Where cloud-base resources are **CONNECTED** to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. 
# On-premise
It is also know as private cloud deployment. Here, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools. Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
