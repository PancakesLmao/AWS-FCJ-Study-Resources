Attaching [[IAM Role]] to an EC2 Instance
# IAM Identities
An IAM identity represents a user, and can be authenticated and then authorized to perform actions in AWS
# Assumable Access
To assume a role, the user must meet the requirements outline in the IAM policy. Role access can be granted to IAM users or federated users
# Permission Policies
Policies determine which actions an identity can perform, on which AWS resources and under which condition
# Temporary credentials
Temporary credentials have a more restricted set of permissions than the standard IAM user, and they expire automatically after a set of period of time
